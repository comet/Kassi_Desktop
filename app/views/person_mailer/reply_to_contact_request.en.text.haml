Hi and thanks for your interest in Kassi!

Kassi is a service where members of local communities can share goods, services and rides. This might mean borrowing a power drill from your neighbor, getting help for computer problems or sharing a ride to work.

The first Kassi community is up and running in Aalto University campus at http://aalto.kassi.eu and now we are expanding the service to other communities.

Do you know a community where Kassi could be useful? It might be a company, a neighborhood, a university campus, an association, you name it. If you have one in mind, please let us know by replying to this email!

Also don't hesitate to contact us in any other related matter. We'd be happy to have a chat with you.

Best Regards, 
Juho Makkonen 
Co-Founder of Kassi
