%h3 What is Kassi?

%p 
  Kassi makes it easier to sell, buy and lend stuff and in general to exchange day-to-day resources within a local community. Kassi users can offer each other items, favors, rides and housing and also request all these from other users.

%p  
  Kassi aims to create a local item and service directory for each community and thus decrease the need for members to buy goods and services outside the community. Thus, use of the service saves both your time and money, and saves the planet at the same time. It is also a great way to meet new people in your neighborhood.
