    I'm Kadie Kelly, a single mom of two boys and the leader of The Oakland Single
    Parents’ Network. I started OSPN in March 2010 to bring single parents in our
    local community together.
  %p
    As a single parent I felt alone for a long time.  And then I realized I wasn’t
    alone.  And since that realization I have not been able to stop envisioning a
    world where life is not so hard and we are not so isolated from each other.
  %p
    OSPN's collaboration with Kassi is another step towards helping single parents
    make everyday lives easier together. You can use the service in whatever way
    best fits your needs: to borrow and lend items, exchange favors, organize
    carpooling, sell or give away things you or your children no longer need and so
    on. I hope you will try it out, give us feedback on what works and what doesn't,
    and, if you like it, invite others around to become users of the service, too!
