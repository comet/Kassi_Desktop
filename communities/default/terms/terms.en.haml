  %h4 Invitation

  %p 
    You are invited to take part in a scientific user study led by Professor Martti Mäntylä of the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT), a joint research institution of the Helsinki University of Technology and the University of Helsinki. The study forms a part of the OtaSizzle project in the MIDE Programme of Helsinki University of Technology. The study involves several test subjects.

  %h4 Purpose of the Research
  %p 
    In line with the project to which it belongs, this study examines social media services and the use of those services. By collecting information on our test subjects, we hope to learn what is most important for service users. The ultimate aim of the study is to produce results that can be used in designing and creating better services.

  %h4 Risks and Discomfort
  %p 
    The methods used during the study present no greater risk to the subjects than normal use of computers and mobile phones does. In the study’s possible interviews and questionnaires you are entitled to skip any questions you are uncomfortable with. Observation of users’ actions “in the field”, in their daily lives, may also be included in the study. This kind of study would be informed in advance and the observers will introduce themselves in advance to test subjects and tell them about the research and their methods. Observation is not obligatory and you have right to refuse to participate. 

  %h4 Benefits for Participants and the Community 
  %p 
    Besides the usefulness of the actual services, there is no other particular benefit from participating in the study. Although you receive no personal gain from participating, we believe that by taking part you will help to produce information that will lead to better services being designed and offered in the future.

  %h4 Confidentiality
  %p 
    During the study, we will collect data on you and your use of services. Data is collected partly by asking you directly and observing your actions, but also by collecting some information automatically during use of service. All the data collected on you during the study is treated confidentially and is only accessible by the staff of the research project and possible third parties that are responsible for the upkeep of the service. Data related to you is only used in combination with other data. In the analysis, data will be collated using phone numbers, IMEI codes and other identifiers. If the upkeep of the service will be discontinued after the ending of this five-year research project, all identifying research data will be destroyed at the latest at the end of the research project. Whenever the study’s outcomes are published or processed scientifically or otherwise, individual test subjects will not be mentioned, nor can they be identified from the data. There is a public data file description that determines how data is processed, stored and eventually destroyed.
  %p 
    This research complies with the Finnish Personal Data Act (523/1999), which is based on EU legislation.

  %h4 Participation and Cancellation 
  %p 
    If you decide to take part in the study, you have the right to cancel your participation at any time, without any consequences. You also have the right not to answer any questions you don't want to answer, and still continue participating in the study. In the unlikely event that the circumstances should require it, the Research Director has the right to cancel your participation.
