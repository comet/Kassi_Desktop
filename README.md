# Kassi

Kassi is a community resource exchange service built with Ruby on Rails. 

NOTICE: The open source publication of Kassi is still quite fresh and installation 
and stability are not yet as good as we would like them to be. Please report any issues 
you encounter and feel free to improve the instructions in wiki (http://wiki.github.com/sizzlelab/Kassi/)


Kassi relies on Aalto Social Interface (http://github.com/sizzlelab/asi) on its 
user management and few other things, so it can't be run alone.

For serious use you need to install your own ASI or get access to an existing one, 
but for testing you can use the default test account on OtaSizzle's test server.
